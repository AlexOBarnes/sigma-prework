#Create a file called age.py
#You can run this file by navigating to it through the terminal and
#typing python age.py
#Edit this code in VS Code
#Write a short programme that when given a date calculates the age
#between the current date and the given date
#An example input and output might be
#i. 01-01-1990 should be 34
#ii. 04-12-1972 should be 51
#You will likely need to use the python datetime module
